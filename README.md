roman-emperors
==============

Linked data about Roman emperors.

This dataset uses the published dbpedia resource URIs for Roman Emperors (the persons themselves) as a starting point for making useful assertions about these individuals in the linked data space. The main goal is to align these URIs with any other key URIs (now or in the future) for the same persons and then to attribute these "same as" relationships with links to descriptive documents or other data that have not so far made it into the linked data graph (especially legacy web resources). Multiple names for the emperors are only incidental to the dataset; no attempt is being made to produce (in this dataset) a comprehensive set of alternate names.

Status of the work
-------------------

As of 2012-06-19:

* I believe the list of dbpedia resource URIs are complete (235 URIs).
* I have begun work aligning the dbpedia URIs to viaf.org URIs, but the work is not complete. 163 dbpedia URIs do not have matching viaf URIs (though some may never as the dbpedia list includes minor usurpers and the like).
* I have added URIs for the documents on http://roman-emperors.org that describe and discuss some of these emperors; I believe that list is complete (105 matches).

Method

Hacking around in Google Refine and with XSLT.
